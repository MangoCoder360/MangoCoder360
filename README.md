# Licensing for repositories that do not contain a license:
If you would like to use some of my code in your own projects that's awesome but I would like to know about it. For most of my code all I ask is that you give me credit. To request permission to use my code, send an email to contact@reubenschiopu.com with the link to the code you want to use and some details about what project you want to use it in.

Make sure to remember, just because the code is on GitHub and is publicly accessible, does not mean you have the rights to use it.
